# CLAUDE Memory File

This file contains workflow preferences and guidelines for working on this repository.

## Branching Strategy

**ALWAYS create a feature or bug fix branch before making changes to the codebase.**

- For new features: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
- For bug fixes: `git checkout -b bugfix/descriptive-name`
- Never commit directly to the `main` branch

## Documentation Requirements

**When adding new projects/sketches, ALWAYS update:**

1. **README.md** - Add the new project to the documentation
2. **index.html** (or index page) - Ensure the new project appears in the UI listing

## General Workflow

1. Create appropriate branch before starting work
2. Implement the feature or fix
3. Update documentation (README and index page if adding new projects)
4. Test changes locally
5. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
6. Create pull request for review

## Repository Context

This is a creative coding sketches repository. Each new sketch/project should be properly documented and made discoverable through both the README and the web interface.
